# CCA_algorithm
classification algorithm
There are five different codes for the CCA algorithm which is: 
CCA_0: represent the CCA algorithm without using clustering.
CCA_2: Represent the CCA algorithm with 2 clusters for each class.
CCA_3: Represent the CCA algorithm with 3 clusters for each class.
CCA_6: Represent the CCA algorithm with 6 clusters for each class.
Dis_F: Represent the function for distance matrix.
